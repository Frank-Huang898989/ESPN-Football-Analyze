  * Create Web Scraping methods to grab ESPN Football data, Found the API hidden pattern, and automize the grab process.
  * Built a data cleaning process and give the company the real important result.
  * Made Poisson model and Logistic regression to predict the game in a different aspect. 
  * Automize the Excel process to produce the report more efficiently.
